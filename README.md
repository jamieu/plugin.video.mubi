# MUBI Addon for Kodi

## What it is

Plugin to stream video from MUBI.com within Kodi / XBMC.

A [MUBI](https://www.mubi.com) account is required to use this plugin.

## Notes

You will need to have the [inputstream.adaptive](https://github.com/peak3d/inputstream.adaptive) plugin installed and enabled for this to work since Mubi now uses Dash (mpd).

You can find this in the Ubuntu PPA.

### DRM

A small subset of the films use DRM and cannot yet be played. I am working on implementing this however it will require Kodi 18 and a manual install of DRM libraries (`widevine`).
